# Contributing to Social Media Filters

Thank you for wanting to improve the list! To keep the automation working correctly, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. Edit the Source Only
Please make all changes **only** in the `filterlist.txt` file in the root directory. 

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** edit files in the `dist/` folder. These are automatically generated and any manual changes will be overwritten.

### 2. Maintain the Markers
When adding new rules, ensure they stay within the correct section markers:
```
! ----- NAME FILTERS -----
... your rules here ...
! ----- END OF NAME FILTERS -----
```
